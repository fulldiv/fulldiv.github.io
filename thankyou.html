    <h3>Thank you for subscribing to Fulldiv</h3>

    <p>We are going to cover full stack development, what it means and all the tools, languages, libraries and frameworks you need to learn to be able to develop websites, mobile and web applications, server side scripts and much more.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>A full stack developer is a web developer who works with both the front and back ends of a website or application—meaning they can tackle projects that involve databases, building user-facing websites.</p>
    <ul>
      <li style="list-style-type:none;">― Front end developers build the visible parts of websites that users see and interact within their web browsers.</li>
      <br>
      <li style="list-style-type:none;">— The front end of a website (or web or mobile application) is the part a user sees and directly interacts with. The front end is built with languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript
</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Back end developers build the “under the hood” parts of websites that users don’t interact with directly.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We will also use Javascript for back end development with Nodejs which is an environment to run javascript outside the browser box.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>There are six main topics we will go through:</h4>
    <p>▶ <strong>HTML</strong> or Hypertext Markup Language, it is a type of markup language, It wraps, or “marks up” data within HTML tags, which define the data and describe its purpose on the webpage.</p><br>
    <p>▶ <strong>CSS</strong> or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing how a document written in a markup language such as HTML will look like, think of it as the makeup that makes HTML look beautiful.</p><br>
    <p>▶ <strong>Javascript</strong> is the Programming Language for the Web although it can be used to develop mobile applications, server side code and much more. HTML and CSS are static meaning that You cannot change HTML and CSS after a website gets loaded, thats where Javascript comes to play, JavaScript gives you the ability to update and change the HTML and CSS on the page either automatically or through an interaction by the user such as a mouse click or hover. JavaScript can also calculate, manipulate and validate data.</p><br>
    <p>▶ <strong>Libraries and frameworks</strong> add functionality to your code and make your life easier by simplifying complex problems so you can focus on finishing your project.</p><br>
    <p>▶ <strong>Databases</strong> are used to organize and store data.</p><br>
    <p>▶ <strong>Version control</strong> which is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.</p><br>
    <p>▶ <strong>API</strong> stands for Application Programming Interface, it is an interface or communication protocol that allows different parts of a computer program to talk to each other and exchange data.</p><br><br><br><br>
    <p>Each lesson in this course will be 5-10 minutes long and there will be 3-5 new lessons every week. We will have short and interactive quizzes after each section of this course to test your understanding of what you have learned on top of extra study materials to deepen your understanding. Once you get a little comfortable with coding, you will build projects that give you the chance to practice what you’ve learned.</p><br>
    <p>Don't worry though, we will start with basic projects and progress to more complex tasks as you get more advanced. After completing all the projects, you’ll build a portfolio website to share with prospective employers, we will even help you find a job once you are ready.</p><br><br><br><br><br>
    <p> See you soon.<strong>(check your inbox for  access information to our online community and course website.)</strong></p><br><br><br><br><br>
